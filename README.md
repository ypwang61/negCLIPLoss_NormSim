# CLIPLoss and Norm-Based Data Selection Methods for Multimodal Contrastive Learning
[[ Paper ]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19547)

This paper replaces the original VAS paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02055).

This is an official code of negCLIPLoss & NormSim, which is a simple but efficient data selection method for CLIP model.
